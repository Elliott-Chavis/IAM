# Lab 09: Entra ID Access Reviews (Governance Loop)

This lab implements an automated attestation loop for high-privilege accounts. While Lab 08 focused on **Just-In-Time (JIT)** access, Lab 09 ensures that users who are "Eligible" for roles are periodically reviewed and revoked if they no longer need the permission.

## 🛡️ Prerequisites
* **Identity Menu:** Microsoft Entra admin center
* **License:** Entra ID P2 (Required)
* **Dependency:** Completion of Lab 08 (An eligible assignment must exist).

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Review Name** | PIM-GA-Monthly-Audit | Clear identification for auditors. |

## 3. Automation: Zero Trust Settings
On the **Settings** tab, enforce the following:

* **Auto apply results:** **Enable** (Decisions take effect automatically).
* **If reviewers don't respond:** **Remove access** (Security-First fallback).
* **Justification required:** **Yes**.

Click **Review + Create** and then **Create**.

## 4. Execution: Testing (Immediate Bypass)
Since the "Inactive" filter ignores new users, use this trick to test right now:

1. **Create Fast Review:** Create another review named `LAB-TEST-NOW`.
2. **Bypass Inactivity:** **Uncheck** "Inactive users only" so your test user appears immediately.
3. **Wait:** Give it 3–5 minutes to initialize (Status: `InProgress`).
4. **Perform Review:** * Open Incognito -> Go to **myaccess.microsoft.com**.
   * Log in as the **Reviewer**.
   * Select **Access reviews**, find your review, select the **Test User**, and click **Deny**.
5. **Fast-Forward:** * In the Admin portal, go to your review and click **Stop**.
   * Once stopped, click **Apply**.

## 5. Verification
1. Go to **PIM > Microsoft Entra roles > Assignments**.
2. Search for your **Test User**.
3. **Result:** The user should be **automatically removed
